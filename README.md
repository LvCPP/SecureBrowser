# SecureBrowser (SB)

__A fully automated solution for online proctoring__<br/>
SB is a fully automated solution that eliminates the need for live proctors. Students can take the exam at any time of the day or night, and instructors can review flagging and assessment data on their own schedule.

__Record student exam sessions with a webcam__<br/>
Students use a webcam to record themselves during an exam. A "startup sequence" includes a webcam check and other requirements set by the instructor, such as showing identification or making a short video of the exam environment. Only the instructor can review video recordings or data from the exam session.

__Suspicious behavior is automatically flagged__<br/>
SB automatically flags students for suspicious behavior, such as leaving the computer during the exam, or a different person entering the video frame. This, along with other data, provides useful information to the instructor about the exam session.

__Integrates seamlessly with Learning Management Systems__<br/>
SB integrates seamlessly with Moodle. Students access exams from within the LMS itself. Instructors do everything within the LMS too, including post-exam review of the flagging data.

__Procedure of authentication__<br/>
SB will start with predefined steps:
1. Need to take photo trainee with ID (passport, etc).<br/>
2. Due to exam app will take photo from webcam + screens from desktop (please pay attansion that we need to take screens from all connected monitors).
